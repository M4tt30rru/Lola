#Lola
The Language Of Languge Augmentation was found by Ido Zmiri under the supervising of Prof. Yossi Gil in the Technion.
Lola is a tool for language extensions and can equip any language with new syntax and semantics.
Lola's syntax is Macro based, and designed to run on a precompiled code, transforming it from the new syntax to the domain syntax.
Compared to other preprocessor tools, Lola is much powerfull and is even equipped with a Python engine.
